# PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS

### Project 1: Route Planner
Used OpenStreetMap data along with IOD2 visualization library to build a route planner that finds. path between two points on a real-world map.

### Project 2: Process Monitor
Created a system monitor (similar to Linux htop command) that shows what's happening on the computer: processes, id, CPU & Memory usage and much more using object-oriented C++ concepts.

### Project 3: Smart Pointers
Built my own smaprt point and compared it's performance to the standard-issue smart pointers to grow my knowledge to the C++ smart-pointers which are part of the Modern C++ library.

### Project 4: Concurrent Traffic Simulation
Built a multithreaded traffic simulator using a real urban map. Run each vehicle on a separate thread, and manage intersections to facilitate traffic flow and avoid collisions.

### Project 5: Capstone Project
To Be Decided
