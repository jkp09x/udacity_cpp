# Udacity C++ Nanodegree Projects

# PROJECTS
- #### âœ… [Project 1 - Route Planning](https://github.com/jkp09x/udacity-route_planning)
      Used OpenStreetMap data along with IOD2 visualization library to build a route planner that finds. path between two points on a real-world map.
- #### âœ… [Project 2 - System Monitor](https://github.com/jkp09x/udacity-system_monitor)
      Created a system monitor (similar to Linux htop command) that shows what's happening on the computer: processes, id, CPU & Memory usage and much more using object-oriented C++ concepts.
- #### ðŸ—“ [Project 3 - Memory Mgmt Chatbot]()
      # TODO: Fill in details about the project
- #### ðŸ—“ [Project 4 - Traffic Simulation]()
      Built a multithreaded traffic simulator using a real urban map. Run each vehicle on a separate thread, and manage intersections to facilitate traffic flow and avoid collisions.
- #### ðŸ—“ [Project 5 - Capstone]()
      To Be Decided

## FOUNDATIONS
- Learn basic C++ syntax, functions, containers, and compiling and linking with multiple files. Use OpenStreetMap and the 2D visualization library IO2D to build a route planner that displays a path between two points on a map.

## Object-Oriented Programming
- Explore Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++ with examples and exercises covering the essentials of OOP like abstraction and inheritance all the way through to advanced topics like polymorphism and templates. In the end, youâ€™ll build a Linux system monitor application to demonstrate C++ OOP in action!

## Memory Management
- Discover the complexity of memory management in C++ by diving deep into stack vs. heap, pointers, references, new, delete and much more. By the end, youâ€™ll write your very own smart pointer!

## Concurrency
- Concurrent programming runs multiple threads of execution in parallel. Concurrency is an advanced programming technique that, when properly implemented, can dramatically accelerate your C++ programs.

## Capstone
- Put your C++ skills to use on a project of your own! Youâ€™ll utilize the core concepts from this Nanodegree program - object-oriented programming, memory management, and concurrency - to build your own application using C++.
