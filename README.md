# COURSE LIST & DESCRIPTIONS

## FOUNDATIONS
- #### Project 1: Route Planner
      Used OpenStreetMap data along with IOD2 visualization library to build a route planner that finds. path between two points on a real-world map.

## Object-Oriented Programming
- #### Project 2: Process Monitor
      Created a system monitor (similar to Linux htop command) that shows what's happening on the computer: processes, id, CPU & Memory usage and much more using object-oriented C++ concepts.

## Memory Management
- #### Project 3: Memory Management Chatbot
      # TODO: Fill in details about the project

## Concurrency
- #### Project 4: Concurrent Traffic Simulation
      Built a multithreaded traffic simulator using a real urban map. Run each vehicle on a separate thread, and manage intersections to facilitate traffic flow and avoid collisions.

## Capstone
- #### Project 5: Capstone Project
      To Be Decided
