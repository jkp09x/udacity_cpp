# Udacity C++ Nanodegree Projects

# PROJECTS
- #### âœ… [Project 1 - Route Planning](https://github.com/jkp09x/udacity-route_planning)
  Create a route planner that plots a path between two points on a map using real map data from the [OpenStreeMap project](https://www.openstreetmap.org/).
- #### âœ… [Project 2 - System Monitor](https://github.com/jkp09x/udacity-system_monitor)
  Created a system monitor (similar to Linux htop command) that shows what's happening on the computer: processes, id, CPU & Memory usage and much more using object-oriented C++ concepts.
- #### ðŸ—“ [Project 3 - Memory Mgmt Chatbot]()
  **Purpose:** In this project you will analyze and modify an existing ChatBot program, which is able to discuss some memory management topics based on the content of a knowledge base. The program can be executed and works as intended. However, no advanced concepts as discussed in this course have been used. There are no smart pointers, no move semantics and not much thought has been given on ownership and on memory allocation.
  
  **Your task:** Use the course knowledge to optimize the ChatBot program from a memory management perspective. There is a total of five tasks to be completed.

- #### ðŸ—“ [Project 4 - Traffic Simulation]()
  Built a multithreaded traffic simulator using a real urban map. Run each vehicle on a separate thread, and manage intersections to facilitate traffic flow and avoid collisions.
- #### ðŸ—“ [Project 5 - Capstone]()
  To Be Decided

## Foundations
- Learn basic C++ syntax, functions, containers, and compiling and linking with multiple files. Use OpenStreetMap and the 2D visualization library IO2D to build a route planner that displays a path between two points on a map.

## Object-Oriented Programming
- Explore Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++ with examples and exercises covering the essentials of OOP like abstraction and inheritance all the way through to advanced topics like polymorphism and templates. In the end, youâ€™ll build a Linux system monitor application to demonstrate C++ OOP in action!

## Memory Management
- Discover the complexity of memory management in C++ by diving deep into stack vs. heap, pointers, references, new, delete and much more. By the end, youâ€™ll write your very own smart pointer!

## Concurrency
- Concurrent programming runs multiple threads of execution in parallel. Concurrency is an advanced programming technique that, when properly implemented, can dramatically accelerate your C++ programs.

## Capstone
- Put your C++ skills to use on a project of your own! Youâ€™ll utilize the core concepts from this Nanodegree program - object-oriented programming, memory management, and concurrency - to build your own application using C++.
