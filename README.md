# COURSE LIST & DESCRIPTIONS

## FOUNDATIONS
- #### Lesson 01: Welcome
- #### Lesson 02: Introduction to the C++ Language
      Learned the basics of C++ based on previous programming experience.
- #### Lesson 03: A* Search
      Learned about the A search algorithm and implement the algorithm  to plan a path through the obstacles in the ASCII board.
- #### Lesson 04: Writing Multifile Programs
      Learned the syntax for C++ header files, pointers, build tools and classes.
- #### Project 1: Route Planner
      Used OpenStreetMap data along with IOD2 visualization library to build a route planner that finds. path between two points on a real-world map.

## Object-Oriented Programming
- #### Project 2: Process Monitor
      Created a system monitor (similar to Linux htop command) that shows what's happening on the computer: processes, id, CPU & Memory usage and much more using object-oriented C++ concepts.

## Memory Management
- #### Project 3: Smart Pointers
      Built my own smaprt point and compared it's performance to the standard-issue smart pointers to grow my knowledge to the C++ smart-pointers which are part of the Modern C++ library.

## Concurrency
- #### Project 4: Concurrent Traffic Simulation
      Built a multithreaded traffic simulator using a real urban map. Run each vehicle on a separate thread, and manage intersections to facilitate traffic flow and avoid collisions.

## Capstone
- #### Project 5: Capstone Project
      To Be Decided
